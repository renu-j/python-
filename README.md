# Python Practice Codes  

Welcome to my **Python Practice Repository**  
This repository includes variou  Python programs I’ve written while learning and strengthening my programming skills.  
Each file focuses on a **different Python concept** — from basics to logic-based exercises.  

---

## Topics I’ve Practiced

###  Python Basics
- Printing output and taking input  
- Variables and data types  
- Indexing and slicing concepts  

###  Conditional Statements
- Using `if`, `elif`, and `else`  
- Checking conditions and making decisions  
- Real examples like grade checkers and number tests  

###  Strings
- String **indexing** and **slicing** examples  
- Reversing a string using slicing (`[::-1]`)  
- Palindrome check programs (to see if a word reads the same backward)  

###  Lists & Tuples
- Creating and accessing **lists** and **tuples**  
- Modifying lists, counting elements, and basic operations  
- Tuple examples like counting specific grades or elements  

###  Logic & Practice Programs
- Reverse words in a sentence  
- Palindrome word checker  
- Counting grades from a tuple  
- Slicing and reversing practice  
- Index-based element extraction  

##  Learning Goal

This repository is a **collection of my practice files** while learning Python.  
It helps me to:
- Build a strong foundation in **Python programming**  
- Understand basic **data handling and string logic**  
- Prepare for future fields like **Data Analysis & Automation**
